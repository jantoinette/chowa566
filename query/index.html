        <p>Kevin Lee (TC: 李夢遠) is a Chinese American multi-disciplinary creative whose writing, music, and videography loosely centers around the wonderful confusion of Asian American-ness and the uncertain identity found at the core of third culture experiences. He draws on his experiences growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area and recurring visits to China, as well as broader solo trips later in life, to paint meditative inquiries on the subject of Asian-ness.<br>His work looks to provoke simple yet profound contemplation and asks questions without looking for answers or fixating. He uses his Chinese name, <a href="https://mngyuan.com"><span>mngyuan</span></a>, for his work which means dream far.</p>

        <p><span class="blur">At Facebook you go through boot camp as an engineer, so you go through like six to ten weeks of choosing a team, and getting up to speed. And you talk to managers, so you do little interviews with them. And I remember I didn't really know what the fuck I was trying to get out of those conversations, I just remember being in those conversations and being like, well, there's nothing really I want out of this job. So maybe I should just talk to these people about getting more money.</span></p>

        <p><span class="blur">And so, I talked to them about, like, how to grow my career and how to become a manager. And I ultimately didn't care about that either. I just didn't have some&shything to climb towards anymore. You know, I wasn't taking tests anymore. I wasn't acing classes. And I guess the other thing was,</span><span onmouseenter="unblurText(this)" onmouseout="blurText(this)"> I needed to feel like I was still learning. Work really quickly became a grind, and I was learning shit I didn't care about.</span><span class="blur"> I guess it makes me a bad employee that I didn't care about planning and communicating and working cross functionally and stuff like that, which is still a little confusing with my kind of design career that I'm on right now. There's still things I know, I don't really care about. Like, creating business value, and even things like extensive user research, I'm like a little eh about.</span></p>

Just the amount of pressure I would feel, not just from my parents, but from myself and from other people, too, like, you know, that's Sofia Coppola’s kid, that's why he's making films.

        <p><span class="blur">I really like traveling. In Japan, there are people falling asleep on subway stations every day. And it's like, wow, people think this is normal. And you go to Thailand, every single piece of food I ordered came with a small bag of chili and a small bag of sugar. And this is normal. It helps you realize that you can really draw inspiration from a lot of different places. The internet breaks down a lot of these walls, but I think a lot of people are still in their places, you know, they're still in their mindset of where they grew up.</span></p>
